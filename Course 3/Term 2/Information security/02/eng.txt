Once upon a time, in a small forest covered with a blanket of white snow, lived a little hedgehog named Henry. Henry was not like other hedgehogs. While his friends preferred to stay warm and cozy in their burrows during the winter, Henry loved the snow.

Every morning, as the sun rose and cast a golden glow on the snow, Henry would step out of his burrow. He loved the crunch of the snow under his tiny feet and the way his breath fogged up in the cold air. He would roll around in the snow, making little hedgehog-sized snow angels.

One day, as Henry was playing in the snow, he saw something glittering. It was a small, frozen pond, its surface shining like a mirror. Henry had an idea. He rolled into a tight ball and slid across the ice. Whee! It was the most fun he'd ever had!

Days turned into weeks, and Henry spent his winter sliding on the ice, making snow angels, and even building a snow-hedgehog. He showed his friends how much fun winter could be, and soon, they started joining him.

By the time spring arrived, Henry had not only enjoyed a wonderful winter but also helped his friends see the beauty of the season. From then on, the hedgehogs of the forest no longer dreaded winter. Instead, they looked forward to the snow, the play, and the joy it brought.

And Henry? He was the happiest hedgehog, for he had shared his love for snow with everyone.
